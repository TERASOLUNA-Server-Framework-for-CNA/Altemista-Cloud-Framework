From ACF we will provide a easy way to deploy any image stream into Altemista. When it is added Altemista feature ,a yaml file will be created in order to import in Altemista. It is possible to customize as much as the user needs in order to deploy his project.
In the following paragraph , we will give a explanation about the content of the yaml file.

[source,yaml]
./deployment.yaml
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: List			<!--1-->
items:
...
----

<1> defines the object as a list in order to add all the components needed to create an application

LetÂ´s start with the service component:

[source,yaml]
./deployment.yaml
----
...

- apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: service-example
    labels:
      app: deployment-example
  spec:
    ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      name: 8080-tcp
    selector:
      deploymentconfig: deployment-example

...

----
If you need further information about service, please go to https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/integrating_external_services.html[here^]


Next, the volume component:

[source,yaml]
./deployment.yaml
----
...

- apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: volume-name
  spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce 
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi 
...
----

If you need further information about volume, please go to https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volume-claims[here^]



In the case of the application uses many resources, it may happen that when you try to lift the pod, it will restart and will not start. 
This is because you need authoring a pod configuration file, you can optionally specify how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs in order to better schedule pods in the cluster and ensure satisfactory performance.

[source,yaml]
./deployment.yaml
----
...

- apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: volume-name
  spec:
   - image: openshift/hello-openshift
     name: hello-openshift
     resources:
       requests:
         cpu: 200m  <!--1-->
         memory: 500Mi  <!--2-->
       limits:
         cpu: 500m  <!--3-->
         memory: 800Mi  <!--4-->
...
----


<1> The container requests 200m CPU.
<2> The container requests 500Mi memory.
<3> The container limits 500m CPU.
<4> The container limits 800Mi memory.

For more information on how to add the limits for the container, please go to https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/dev_guide/compute_resources.html#dev-compute-resources[here^]


Here the deployment component:

[source,yaml]
./deployment.yaml
----
...

- apiVersion: v1
  kind: DeploymentConfig
  metadata:
    name: deployment-name
  spec:
    replicas: 1		<!--1-->
    selector:
      deploymentconfig: deployment-name
    strategy:
      type: Recreate
    template:		<!--2-->
      metadata:
        labels:
          deploymentconfig: deployment-name
      spec:
        volumes:	<!--3-->
        - name: log
          persistentVolumeClaim:
               claimName: volume-name      
        containers:
        - image: boot-test		<!--4-->
          name: deployment-name
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8080
            protocol: TCP
          volumeMounts:				<!--5-->
            - mountPath: /log
              name: log
    triggers:
    - type: ConfigChange		<!--6-->
    - imageChangeParams:
        automatic: true
        containerNames:
        - deployment-name
        from:
          kind: ImageStreamTag
          name: boot-test:latest
      type: ImageChange
...
 
----

<1> There will be 1 replicas of frontend by default.
<2> The replication controller template named deployment-name describes a docker image.
<3> Name of the persistence volume declared previously 
<4> The image stream that deployment has to use.
<5> Path of the volume in order to deploy ACF applications.
<6>	A configuration change trigger causes a new deployment to be created any time the replication controller template changes.

If you need further information about deployment, please go to https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/deployments.html[here^]

And finally, the route component:

[source,yaml]
./deployment.yaml
----
...

- apiVersion: v1
  kind: Route
  metadata:
    name: route-example
  spec:
    host: route-example-altemista.helix.everis.cloud
    port:
        targetPort: 8080-tcp
    to:
        kind: Service
        name: service-example     
        
...

----

You can create the route component in the Altemista console if you prefer:

image::altemista-cloudfwk-documentation/altemista/route.png[align="center"]

If you need further information about route, please go to https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/route.html[here^]

For microservices, you will need to add an environment variable to indicate the host of the config-server in the registry, gateway and microservices applications.

[source,yaml]
./deployment.yaml
----
...

containers:
        - env:
            - name: CONFIG_HOST
              value: config-server   
        
...

----

Once you have created your yaml file, you can deploy it in Altemista. Choose the option "IMPORT YAML/JSON" and you will see a pop up where you can paste the content of your file or you can choose your file to upload it
