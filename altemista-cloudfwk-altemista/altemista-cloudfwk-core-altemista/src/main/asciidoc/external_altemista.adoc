Before deploying an image from an external registry in Altemista, it is needed to push it, it can be used our Docker <<push-image,feature>> in order to push the image to docker hub.

For deploying an application from an existing container image, you need to choose to the "Deploy Image" tab.

And then check the "Image name" option, and type "<your-repository>/<image-name>"

IMPORTANT: it will be needed to add a storage for the path where we write the log by logback feature if you use a ACF project, it should be needed to add the path where it is configured in the logback.xml, by default "/log".
