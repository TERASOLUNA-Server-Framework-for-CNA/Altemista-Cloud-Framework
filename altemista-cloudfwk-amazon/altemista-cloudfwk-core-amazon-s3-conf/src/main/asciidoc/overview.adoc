Amazon:S3 provides a portable client interface to Amazon Simple Storage System (S3).

Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.

From {framework} give some basic configurations in order to start using quickly.


= Amazon Console

We need to create our bucket in the amazon console. If we go to our AWS console, in our S3 console:

Choose *Create bucket*, input information for creating bucket:

We need a user to work with S3 ,go to this https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/[site^]

Got to "IAM" section and in the navigation pane, choose *Users* and then choose *Add user*.

Input User name, choose *Programmatic access* for Access type:

Press *Next: Permissions* button and go to *Set permissions* for your user.
Now, choose *Attach existing policies* directly and filter policy type s3, then check *AmazonS3FullAccess*:

And finally click over *Create User*:


= Configuration

In the following paragraphs you can see the configuration we provide from {framework} in order to set up a infrastructure configuration. You can change it if you need it.
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
./my-application-env/src/main/resources/properties/my-application-module-core-amazon-s3.properties
----

*.aws.access.key.id=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}	<!--1-->
*.aws.access.key.secret=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}	<!--2-->
*.aws.region=${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}	<!--3-->
*.aws.s3.audio.bucket={bucket}	<!--4-->

----
<1>  *SDK key id configuration*: user allows to assign a profile that is authorized by a role while starting an EC2 instance .

<2> *SDK key password configuration*: password allows to assign a profile that is authorized by a role while starting an EC2 instance .

<3> *Region configuration*: usually our region should be "eu-west-1".

<4> *Bucket Configuration*: configuration needed for our bucket.

And finally We provide a class where you need to edit to upload or delete a file It could be like this:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
./amazon/SimpleS3Service.java

@Component
public class SimpleS3Service 
{
    private String awsS3AudioBucket;
    private AmazonS3 amazonS3;

	private String bucket;

                .withCredentials(awsCredentialsProvider)
                .withRegion(awsRegion.getName()).build();
        this.awsS3AudioBucket = awsS3AudioBucket;
    }
    @Async
    public void uploadFileToS3Bucket(MultipartFile multipartFile, boolean enablePublicReadAccess) 
    {
        String fileName = multipartFile.getOriginalFilename();

        try {
            //creating the file in the server (temporarily)
            File file = new File(fileName);
            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
            fos.write(multipartFile.getBytes());
            fos.close();

            PutObjectRequest putObjectRequest = new PutObjectRequest(this.awsS3AudioBucket, fileName, file);

            if (enablePublicReadAccess) {
                putObjectRequest.withCannedAcl(CannedAccessControlList.PublicRead);
            }
            this.amazonS3.putObject(putObjectRequest);
            //removing the file created in the server
            file.delete();
        } catch (IOException | AmazonServiceException ex) {
            logger.error("error [" + ex.getMessage() + "] occurred while uploading [" + fileName + "] ");
        }
    }

    @Async
    public void deleteFileFromS3Bucket(String fileName) 
    {
        try {
            amazonS3.deleteObject(new DeleteObjectRequest(awsS3AudioBucket, fileName));
        } catch (AmazonServiceException ex) {
            logger.error("error [" + ex.getMessage() + "] occurred while removing [" + fileName + "] ");
        }
    }
