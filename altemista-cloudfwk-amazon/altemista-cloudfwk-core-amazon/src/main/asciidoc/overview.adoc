{framework} Amazon feature enables the capacity of using a suit of components provided by AWS. Amazon Web Services (or AWS) is nowadays one of the most common choices of the infrastructure and hardware providers to use and deploy to. Many Spring applications have tackled challenges of integrating the application infrastructure and the underlying layer. These in-house solutions differ in complexity and the degree of sophistication when it comes to the design and the actual functionality. 

One of the key attributes of success of such a solution besides the proficiency of the team is the overall knowledge and experience with AWS Java SDK. Based on the way Spring Framework has been designed and maintained, it was only a matter of time before Spring introduced a module dedicated to bridging the gap between AWS and the way we configure our Spring applications. 

Spring Cloud for Amazon Web Services, part of the Spring Cloud umbrella project, eases the integration with hosted Amazon Web Services. It offers a convenient way to interact with AWS provided services using well-known Spring idioms and APIs, such as the messaging or caching API. Developers can build their application around the hosted services without having to care about infrastructure or maintenance

From {framework} provided the following spring cloud amazon implementation:

- pass:[<u>Spring Cloud AWS Context</u>]: delivers access to the *Simple Storage Service(S3)* via the Spring resource loader abstraction. Moreover developers can send e-mails using the *Simple E-Mail Service(SES)* and the Spring mail abstraction. Further the developers can introduce declarative caching using the Spring caching support and the ElastiCache caching service.

- pass:[<u>Spring Cloud AWS JDBC</u>]: provides automatic datasource lookup and configuration for the *Relational Database Service(RDS)* which can be used with JDBC or any other support data access technology by Spring.

- pass:[<u>Spring Cloud AWS Messaging</u>]: enables developers to receive and send messages with the *Simple Queueing Service(SQS)* for point-to-point communication. Publish-subscribe messaging is supported with the integration of the Simple Notification Service.

== Basic Concepts

In order to work with AWS, we need to have knowlesge about some Amazon terms:

- pass:[<u>SDK credentials configuration</u>]: In order to make calls to the Amazon Web Service the credentials must be configured for the the Amazon SDK. Spring Cloud AWS provides support to configure an application context specific credentials that are used for each service call for requests done by Spring Cloud AWS components. Therefore there must be exactly one configuration of the credentials for an entire application context.

- pass:[<u>Region configuration</u>]: Amazon Web services are available in different regions. Based on the custom requirements, the user can host the application on different Amazon regions. The spring-cloud-aws-context module provides a way to define the region for the entire application context. 

IMPORTANT: By default they are configured the following environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION. You can create the environment variables and for more information follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html[Amazon documentation^] .
