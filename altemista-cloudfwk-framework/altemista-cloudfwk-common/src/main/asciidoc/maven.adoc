The maven dependency of the _common_ nature is:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.altemista.cloudfwk.framework</groupId>
  <artifactId>altemista-cloudfwk-common</artifactId>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

As the purpose of the _common_ nature is to create lightweight projects that can be shared, even with third parties, the scope of the dependency is _provided_ to avoid tight coupling with a strict {framework} version. This favours the usage of the project in any other {framework} application disregarding the version.
