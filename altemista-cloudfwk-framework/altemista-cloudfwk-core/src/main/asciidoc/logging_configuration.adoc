In a {framework} application, Logback is configured using `classpath:logback/logback.xml` (i.e.: `<PROJECT_ROOT>/src/main/resources/logback/logback.xml`) instead of the usual `classpath:logback.xml`.

As previously stated, this configuration will be loaded by {framework} in an environment-aware manner, so it is possible to have multiple configuration files to be loaded in different environments. The naming schema of this configuration files is: `classpath:logback/logback[.<environment>].xml`. E.g.: `logback.local.xml` for _local_ development environments, `logback.pro.xml` for production, etc.

TIP: For a detailed guide on how to configure Logback in a {framework} application, please refer to the http://terasolunaorg.github.io/guideline/5.2.0.RELEASE/en/ArchitectureInDetail/GeneralFuncDetail/Logging.html[Logging chapter] of the http://terasolunaorg.github.io/guideline/5.2.0.RELEASE/en/index.html[TERASOLUNA Server Framework Development Guideline].

NOTE: If no valid configuration file is found in the application, {framework} includes a default configuration file that complies with the _TERASOLUNA Server Framework Development Guideline_.
