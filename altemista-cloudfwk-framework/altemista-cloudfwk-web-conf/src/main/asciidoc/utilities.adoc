The {framework} web module offers some convenience utility classes.

[[HttpServletResponseWritable]]
`HttpServletResponseWritable`::

This implementation of `ContentWritable` wraps a `HttpServletResponse` and can be used anywhere as any other `ContentWritable` (e.g.: as a destination of the reporting module). This class internally bridges to the proper HTTP headers the values set as path, content type or content length.

CAUTION: It is important to notice that `HttpServletResponse` does not allow to add more headers to the response after the response body has begun to be written, so not all the methods writing to a `ContentWritable` may be suitable to be used with a `HttpServletResponseWritable`.
