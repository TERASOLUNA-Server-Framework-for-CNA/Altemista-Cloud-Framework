On this tutorial we will make a two applications with RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ, which are an open-source enterprise messaging system modeled on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) standard s developed with {framework} version from *{project-version}*.

A message broker acts as an intermediary platform when it comes to processing communication between two applications.
