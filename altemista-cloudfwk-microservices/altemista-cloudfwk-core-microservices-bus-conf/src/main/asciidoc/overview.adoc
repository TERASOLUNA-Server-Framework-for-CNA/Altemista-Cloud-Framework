This module allows to refresh the properties of the microservices without refreshing them.

In the previous chapters, we explained how to build micoreservices and his infrastructure.
The problem you can have is to reload the config changes in Config Client applications, we probably need to trigger /refresh endpoint manually. This is not practical and viable if you have large number of applications.

== Solution

Spring Cloud Bus module can be used to link multiple applications with a message broker and we can broadcast configuration changes.

IN ACF we are using RabbitMQ as message broker and connect multiple applications to receive the configuration change events and refresh the bounded property values. By adding this:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Now, the client will have another endpoint ‘/actuator/bus-refresh’. Calling this endpoint will cause:

	- get the latest configuration from the config server and update its configuration annotated by @RefreshScope
	- send a message to AMQP exchange informing about refresh event
	- all subscribed nodes will update their configuration as well
This way, we don’t need to go to individual nodes and trigger configuration update.

We can explain this by the following picture:
