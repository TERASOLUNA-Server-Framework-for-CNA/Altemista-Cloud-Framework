The _OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server_ feature includes the following configuration:

More graphically, this diagram shows the beans, security configurations and endpoints of the _OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server_ feature:

There are some points to note from this diagram:

* The client details service, provided by the application, is actually used twice:

** By the `authorization-server` itself, through the `client-details-service-ref`.

** Adapted as a `UserDetailsService` to build the `authentication-manager` the framework uses to secure the token endpoints to be accessible to clients only.

* The `oauth2UsersAuthenticationManager` is directly used as the internal authentication manager that holds the end-users of the resource owner password credentials grant.

* The HTTP security element that secures the token endpoints does not support login, as this endpoint is to be accessed by clients programatically.

* A separate HTTP security element, provided by the application, will publish the `/login` endpoint. The authorzation endpoint (`/oauth/authorize`) is covered but not secured by this element. Therefore, this endpoint will be reached but will raise a `InsufficientAuthenticationException` (and, hence, an _401 Unauthorized_ response) if necessary. That will trigger Spring Security to redirect to the log-in page and request end-user credentials. The `appAuthenticationManager` will have the end-users for the authorization code grant and the implicit grant; usually, both `appAuthenticationManager` and `oauth2UsersAuthenticationManager` will be the same authentication manager.
