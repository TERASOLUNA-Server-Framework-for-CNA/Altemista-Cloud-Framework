There are some points to note from this diagram:

* The application (the OAuth 2.0 Resource Server) should secure its resources (under `/api/{asterisk}{asterisk}` in the example) using the authentication manager, the entry point, the access denied handler, the custom filter, and, optionally, the expression handler provided by the framework.

* The application can also override the `oauth2ResourceServerTokenServices` bean as described in the <<altemista-cloudfwk-app-oauth2-ressrv-conf-configuration,configuration>> section of this chapter.
