The _performance_ feature is application-wide, so it can only be installed in aggregator projects. Both _webapp_ and _boot_ natures are supported.

The initial step is to install the core performance feature (the only one available at the beginning). This core performance feature is required to be installed to allow the installation of the JDBC and the web parts of the performance module.

IMPORTANT: To use the JDBC or the web performance features, the core performance feature must be installed first.

WARNING: If the JDBC performacne feature is included but there is no datasource in the application (no relational database feature has been added to any of the business modules of the application), the application will fail to deploy until the configuration is fixed.
