Errors happen, and Spring Cloud Stream provides several flexible mechanisms to handle them. The error handling comes in two flavors:

* *Application* : The error handling is done within the application (custom error handler).

* *System*: The error handling is delegated to the binder (re-queue, DL, and others). Note that the techniques are dependent on binder implementation and the capability of the underlying messaging middleware.

Spring Cloud Stream uses the Spring Retry library to facilitate successful message processing. See Retry Template for more details. However, when all fails, the exceptions thrown by the message handlers are propagated back to the binder. At that point, binder invokes custom error handler or communicates the error back to the messaging system (re-queue, DLQ, and others).

We will be focused on DLQ in the following chapter.

== DLQ - Dead Letter Queue

DLQ allows failed messages to be sent to a special destination: - Dead Letter Queue.

When configured, failed messages are sent to this destination for subsequent re-processing or auditing and reconciliation.

For example, continuing on the previous example and to set up the DLQ with Rabbit binder, you need to set the following property:

[source,properties]
.new-application-boot/application.properties
----
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.auto-bind-dlq=true
----
Keep in mind that, in the above property, "input" corresponds to the name of the input destination binding. The "consumer" indicates that it is a consumer property and "auto-bind-dlq" instructs the binder to configure DLQ for input destination, which results in an additional Rabbit queue named input.<my-group>.dlq
