We are going to deploy an docker image created by Docker feature and pushed in the Altemista registry by importing a yaml file created by Altemista ACF feature. Before to start, make sure you have your image in a external registry o in Altemista registry, for this demo, we will push a local image to Altemista registry and then we will import the file.

=== Push Image

From a ACF docker image, we need to prepare to push the image:

* Tag your image : "docker tag your-image docker-registry-default.helix.everis.cloud/your-project/your-image". Example: "docker tag boot-test docker-registry-default.helix.everis.cloud/altemista/boot-test
*  Authenticate into his docker registry: "docker login docker-registry-default.helix.everis.cloud". Remember to use your token("oc whoami -t") as password.
* Push your image : " "docker push docker-registry-default.helix.everis.cloud/your-project/your-image". Example: "docker push docker-registry-default.helix.everis.cloud/altemista/boot-test
* Now you will be able to see it in "Builds/Image".
	
From here you can deploy it by "Deploy Image" or "Import YAML/JSON", in our case, we are going to use the last option.

=== Use Altemista ACF feature

{framework} Altemista feature has to be added in a [application]-boot module in a Spring Boot application nature.

You could type the Image Name, Deployment Name, Service Name, Route Name and Volume name as you can see in the following screenshot:

=== Import File

Once you have created your yaml file, you can deploy it in Altemista. Choose the option "IMPORT YAML/JSON" and you will see a pop up where you can paste the content of your file or you can choose your file to upload it

If you want to see an example file, please download this link:resources/cloud-altemistafwk-documentation/altemista/deploymentBoot.zip[file].

In this case, you do not need to add a storage, because in the yaml file is added.
