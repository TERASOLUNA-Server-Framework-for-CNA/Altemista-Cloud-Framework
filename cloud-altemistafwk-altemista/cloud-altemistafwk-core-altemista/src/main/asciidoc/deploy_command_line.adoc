You can create a new OpenShift Enterprise application from a local or external image by using either the OpenShift CLI . For example, to create an application from the DockerHub repository:

[source,sh,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
oc new-app <your repository/your-image>
----

To create an application using an image in a private registry, specify the full Docker image specification:

[source,sh,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
oc new-app myregistry:5000/example/myimage
----

If you want more information you can go to this https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/dev_guide/new_app.html#specifying-an-image[site^]


IMPORTANT: it will be needed to add a storage for the path where we write the log by logback feature if you use a ACF project, it should be needed to add the path where it is configured in the logback.xml, by default "/log".
