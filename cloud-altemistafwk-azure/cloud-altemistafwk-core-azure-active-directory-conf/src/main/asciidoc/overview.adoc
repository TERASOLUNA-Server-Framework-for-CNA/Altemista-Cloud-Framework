{framework} Azure Active Directory Features lets your project incorporate a Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service. 


= Create Azure Active Directory instance

To start log into https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal] .

* You can do all of your administrative tasks using the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) portal, including creating a new tenant for your organization. 
If you already have a tenant you can skip this https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/azure/spring-framework/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory?view=azure-java-stable#create-azure-active-directory-instance[steps] .

= Add an application registration for your app.
Once we have configured and created our instance we will need add an application registration for your Spring Boot app.
Select Azure Active Directory from the portal menu, click App registrations, and then click New application registration.
