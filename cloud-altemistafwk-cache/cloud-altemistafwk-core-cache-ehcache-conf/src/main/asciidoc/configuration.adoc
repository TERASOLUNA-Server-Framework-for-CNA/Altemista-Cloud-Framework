The Ehcache-based implementation of the cache module automatically sets up an Ehcache `CacheManager` to be used by the already configured annotation-based cache.

The Ehcache configuration file must be found in the `config/cache/ehcache.xml` path in the classpath, and should be provided by the application. If this feature is installed with the {framework} plug-in, this file will be included with a default configuration as follows:

[source,xml]
.config/cache/ehcache.xml
----
include::{basedir}/cloud-altemistafwk-core-cache-ehcache-conf/src/test/resources/config/cache/ehcache.xml[]

A brief summary of the main Ehcache configuration attributes:

.Main Ehcache cache configuration attributes

|Property |Required |Description

|`name` |yes |The name of the cache. Must be unique.

|`maxEntriesLocalHeap` |yes |Maximum number of objects that will be created in memory (0 meaning unlimited).

|`maxEntriesLocalDisk` |yes |Maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the disk store (0 meaning unlimited).

|`eternal` |yes |If eternal, timeouts are ignored and the element is never expired.

|`maxBytesLocalHeap` |no |Defines how many bytes the cache may use from the VM's heap. This attribute's values are given as `<number>k` for kilobytes, `<number>m` for megabytes, `<number>g` or gigabytes.

|`maxBytesLocalDisk` |no |As for `maxBytesLocalHeap`, but specifies the limit of disk storage.

|`timeToIdleSeconds` |no |Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.

|`timeToLiveSeconds` |no |Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.

|`diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds` |no |The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread.

|`diskSpoolBufferSizeMB` |no |This is the size to allocate the DiskStore for a spool buffer. Writes are made to this area and then asynchronously written to disk.

|`clearOnFlush` |no |whether the MemoryStore should be cleared when flush() is called on the cache.

|`memoryStoreEvictionPolicy` |no a|Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxEntriesLocalHeap limit:

* `LRU` for _Least Recently Used_ (default),
* `FIFO` for _First In First Out_, and
* `LFU` for _Less Frequently Used_.

|`copyOnRead` |no |Whether an Element is copied when being read from a cache.

|`copyOnWrite` |no |Whether an Element is copied when being added to the cache.
