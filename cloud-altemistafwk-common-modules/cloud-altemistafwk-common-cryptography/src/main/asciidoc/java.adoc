By default, the Java Runtime Environemnt (JRE) does not support key sizes of 128 bit and greater. However, this key size is required to use Spring Security RSA.

To upgrade an existing JRE, download _Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength_ and replace both `local_policy.jar` and `US_export_policy.jar` files in the `jre/lib/security` folder of the existing JRE installation:

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/es/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html[Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 7] for Java 7

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html[Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 8] for Java 8

IMPORTANT: When using the {framework} IDE installer, _Java SE Development Kit (JDK)_, both versions 7 and 8, come with _Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength_ already included.
