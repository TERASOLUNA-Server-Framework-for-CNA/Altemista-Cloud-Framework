In order to work with Docker, you will need to install it. Go to this https://docs.docker.com/install/[site^].
We have created two examples to see how Docker works:

=== Spring Boot Example 


In this example , we will be able to run a docker container by a spring boot project which includes swagger and JPA features too. To see more information about how to dockerise your spring boot project by ACF go to https://terasoluna.everis.com/dev/TSFplus%20Reference%20Documentation.html#_docker_in_spring_boot_projects[here^] 


=== Web application Example

In this example , we will be able to run a docker container by a web application project which includes swagger feature too. To see more information about how to dockerise your web application project by ACF go to https://terasoluna.everis.com/dev/TSFplus%20Reference%20Documentation.html#_docker_in_web_application_projects[here^] .

=== Microservice Example

In this example , we will be able to run microservices and theirs infractures in docker containers. 

==== Configuration

Let´s see what we need before to run our docker application.

===== Config Server

include::{basedir}/cloud-altemistafwk-core-docker/demo/config_server.adoc[]

===== Registry Server

include::{basedir}/cloud-altemistafwk-core-docker/demo/registry.adoc[]

===== Gateway Server

include::{basedir}/cloud-altemistafwk-core-docker/demo/gateway.adoc[]

===== Microservice

include::{basedir}/cloud-altemistafwk-core-docker/demo/microservice.adoc[]

==== Run Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. Our docker-compose.yaml looks like:

[source,yml]
.docker-compose
----
version: '3.3'

services:

 eureka:
  build: ./new-application-eureka/new-application-eureka-boot
  image: eureka
  ports:
   - "8761:8761"
  links: 
    - config-server:config-server
  tty:
    true
  restart:
    unless-stopped
  environment:
    - CONFIG_HOST=config-server

 config-server:
  build: ./new-application-config/new-application-config-boot
  image: config-server
  ports:
   - "8888:8888"
  environment:
    - REGISTRY_HOST=eureka
    - CONFIG_HOST=config-server
  tty:
    true
  restart:
    unless-stopped

 gateway:
  build: ./new-application-gateway/new-application-gateway-boot
  image: gateway
  ports:
   - "8765:8765"
  environment:
    - REGISTRY_HOST=eureka
    - CONFIG_HOST=config-server
  tty:
    true
  restart:
    unless-stopped
  links: 
    - config-server:config-server
  depends_on:
    - config-server
 micro:
  build: ./new-application-micro/new-application-micro-boot
  image: micro
  ports:
   - "9001:9001"
  environment:
    - REGISTRY_HOST=eureka
    - CONFIG_HOST=config-server
  tty:
    true
  restart:
    unless-stopped    

# "Windows Docker native"-specific configuration

networks:
 default:
  external:
   name: "nat"
----

IMPORTANT: If you want to know more about docker compose, go to https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/[here^]

===== Build image

In order to run every image we configured previously, we can use the command "docker-compose build"


===== Run docker compose

We have to run the following commands:

* `docker network create nat` to create the network we need for our example.
* `docker-compose up -d config-server` we need to wait until the config server is running.
* `docker-compose up -d` now we can start the rest of components.

As result, we will have all the components registered in eureka, go to http://localhost:8761/ and you will see something like we have below:
