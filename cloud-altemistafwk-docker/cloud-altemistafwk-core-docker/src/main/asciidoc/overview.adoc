{framework} Docker Features Docker enables developers to easily pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container, which can run virtually anywhere.

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.


= Getting started

Here are some resources that will help you get started using Docker in your workflow. Docker provides a web-based https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/[tutorial^] with a command-line simulator that you can try out basic Docker commands with and begin to understand how it works. There is also a beginners guide to https://opensource.com/business/14/7/guide-docker[Docker^] that introduces you to some basic commands and container terminology.

In order to work with Docker, you will need to install it. Go to this https://docs.docker.com/install/[site^]

= Spotify Maven Docker Plugin

The Docker plugin from Spotify is the embodiment of simplicity. It actually supports only two operations: building a Docker image and pushing a Docker image to the Registry.

The plugin is not calling Docker directly but instead acts as a wrapper around spotify maven docker https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven[plugin^]

= DockerFile

Overall, a Dockerfile is much more stripped down than the IA tools, consisting of a single file with a DSL that has a handful of instructions. The format looks like this:

[source,txt]
Dockerfile
----
INSTRUCTION arguments
----

The following table summarizes the instructions; many of these options map directly to option in the "docker run" command:


[width="80%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
|Command  |Description
|ADD        |Copies a file from the host system onto the container
|CMD        |The command that runs when the container starts
|ENV        |Sets an environment variable in the new container
|EXPOSE     |Opens a port for linked containers
|FROM       |The base image to use in the build. This is mandatory and must be the first command in the file.
|MAINTAINER |An optional value for the maintainer of the script
|ONBUILD    |A command that is triggered when the image in the Dcokerfile is used as a base for another image
|RUN        |Executes a command and save the result as a new layer
|USER       |Sets the default user within the container
|VOLUME     |Creates a shared volume that can be shared among containers or by the host machine
|WORKDIR    |Set the default working directory for the container
|======================

if you want to know more commands, please go https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[here^]. Once you've created a Dockerfile and added all your instructions, you can use it to build an image using the spotify maven plugin or the docker build command.
