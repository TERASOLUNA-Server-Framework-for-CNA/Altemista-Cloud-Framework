Docker is available for {framework} boot projects. It will add a file called "Dockerfile" which we can create an image by maven.

[source,txt]
.new-application-boot/Dockerfile
----
FROM openjdk:8		<!--1-->
ADD target/${applicationName}-boot-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ${applicationName}-boot-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar		<!--2-->
ENTRYPOINT ["java" , "-jar", "/${applicationName}-boot-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"]	<!--3-->
----
<1> The FROM instruction sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions.
<2> The ADD instruction add's the local files into the containers specified path.
<3> The ENTRYPOINT instruction should be used to run the software contained by your image, along with any arguments.

IMPORTANT: You can configure this as much as you want in order to achieve the best configuration for your project.

If you add "EXPOSE" command, remember to use this command when you want to run your application "docker run -p  your-port:8080 your-image-name". 
"Your-port" is the one you expose and 8080 is the one you publish, https://medium.freecodecamp.org/expose-vs-publish-docker-port-commands-explained-simply-434593dbc9a3/[here^]
you have more information about it.

And finally, in the pom it will add this piece of code to build the docker image.

[source,xml]
.new-application-boot/pom.xml
----
<plugin>
	<groupId>com.spotify</groupId>
	<artifactId>dockerfile-maven-plugin</artifactId>	<!--1-->
	<version>1.3.7</version>
	<configuration>

		<resources>
			<resource>
				<targetPath>/</targetPath>
				<directory>${project.build.directory}</directory>
				<include>${project.build.finalName}.jar</include>
			</resource>
		</resources>
	</configuration>
</plugin>
----
<1> dockerfile spotify maven plugin to build the docker image
<2> Image name which we have specified in the wizard

IMPORTANT: You can configure this as much as you want in order to achieve the best configuration for your project.

To build the image we will need to run this command "mvn clean package dockerfile:build". 

IMPORTANT: Just the first time, before to build the image, you will need to run mvn clean install from the root project. 

To run the image you just need to follow the official instructions provided by Docker. For example, in the command line, you will need to type "docker run image-name"

TIP: if you are getting an error like "Connect to localhost:2375: Connection refused", you should enable the following setting in Docker:
