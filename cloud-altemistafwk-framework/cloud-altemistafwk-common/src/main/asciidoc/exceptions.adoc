Exception management allows to control abnormal behaviors of the application (such as errors, unavailability, business validations o wrong usage) and decide what to do with them: write a trace in the log, show a message to the user, take an alternative path, etc.

Although it is a very important part of the applications, it gets usually ignored and minimized during early stages of development. However, properly developed applications and algorithms should be designed with the common path in mind, but not forgetting to have the extraordinary situations propertly handled by exceptions. This leads to cleaner, more structured and robust, and easier to maintain, code.

Extending the exception hierarchy defined by _TERASOLUNA Server Framework for Java_, {framework} includes its own base exceptions:

* `cloud.altemista.fwk.common.exception.FrameworkException` as the base for all the framework exceptions, such as `CommonException` or `CoreException`. Inherits from TERASOLUNA `org.terasoluna.gfw.common.exception.SystemException`.

* `cloud.altemista.fwk.common.exception.ApplicationException` as the base for the custom application exceptions. Inherits from TERASOLUNA `org.terasoluna.gfw.common.exception.BusinessException`.

Both exceptions are runtime (unchecked) exceptions and support message internationalization (both implement Spring `MessageSourceResolvable`).

IMPORTANT: All application exceptions should inherit from this class, either directly or indireclty.
