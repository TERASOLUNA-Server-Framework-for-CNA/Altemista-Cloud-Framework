Spring property management is set up out-of-the-box. Any `.properties` file located at the `config/properties` in the classpath will be automatically available to {framework} applications. Additionally, {framework} includes support for <<cloud-altemistafwk-core-properties-environment,execution environment-awareness>>.

endif::getting-started[]

This allows {framework} applications use configurable properties in XML-based configuration:

[source,xml]
.spring/my-application.xml
----
<bean id="..." class="...">
    <property name="remoteUrl" value="${remote.system.url}" />
</bean>
----

Or annotation based:

[source]
----
@Component
public class ExampleBean {

	@Value("${remote.system.url}")
	private String remoteUrl;
	// (...)
----

Configurable properties can be programatically accessde through Spring `Environment` abstraction, as shown in the following example:

[source]
----
include::{basedir}/cloud-altemistafwk-core/src/test/java/cloud/altemista/fwk/core/properties/EnvironmentAwarePropertiesTest.java[tags=example]
----

[[cloud-altemistafwk-core-properties-environment]]
== Execution environment-aware properties

{framework} support enviornment-aware configuration (also called multi-environment configuration). The same properties file can contain the configuration for different execution environments, and the application will use the proper values transparently.

This allows using the same deployable in multiple execution environments, such as staging or production, without any modification.

IMPORTANT: Do not confuse Spring http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-environment[environment abstraction] with {framework} execution environment awareness.

Keys of the execution environment-aware properties are split in two parts. `<environment>.<key>=<value>`, as follows:

* `<environment>` specifies the execution environment where the value is valid. The special value `"*"` acts as a wilcard to make the value valid for all the execution environments.
* `<key>` is the actual key of the property the application will use. I.e.: this key is used as the Spring _placeholder_, without environment prefix, as shown in the previous section.

An example execution environment-aware properties file:
[source,properties]
.config/properties/example.properties
----
*.jdbc.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
*.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/altemista
local.jdbc.username=admindev
staging.jdbc.username=adminint
production.jdbc.username=adminpro
*.jdbc.password= admin
----

TIP: Even when a property does not require to be execution environment-aware, it is recommeded to prefix it with the wildcard prefix (`"*"`).

When a key is defined more than once (e.g.: specific environment, wildcard prefix, and no prefix), conflics are resolved according the following decision table:

[cols="2,2,2,4"]
|===
|Is `<key>` defined? |Is `*.<key>` defined? |Is `<environment>.<key>` defined? |Prevalent value

|* |* |Yes |`<environment>.<key>` value

|Yes |* |No |`<key>` value

|No |Yes |No |`*.<key>` value

|===

The execution environment is set in the `environment` system property. To set this property, define it when launching the JVM that will run the application:

[source,sh]
----
java ... -Denvironment=pro
----

If you are running the {framework} application from within the IDE, VM arguments can be modified inside menu:Run[Run configurations...] as shown in the following image:

NOTE: If no execution environment is defined, {framework} will default to `"local"` execution environment.

[[cloud-altemistafwk-core-properties-external]]
== External properties files

In adition to execution environment-aware properties and the default properties files locations, {framework} supports reading properties from a optional location, usually external to the application.

These external properties always have higher priority than classpath properties, and are environment-aware as well.

This can be achieved by setting a system property before the application starts. With the default configuration of the framework, the property is named `external.configuration.path`:

[source,sh]
----
java ... -Dexternal.configuration.path=file:/var/my-application/config
----

TIP: This feature is particularly useful when sensitive values (such as password) are not know to the developers but to system administrators.
