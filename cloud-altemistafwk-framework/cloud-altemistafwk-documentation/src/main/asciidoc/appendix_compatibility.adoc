One of the advantages given by the use of {framework} is independence through a fully open architecture. The framework compatibility has been tested on different Java EE servers:

* Apache Tomcat
* Jetty
* JBoss Enterprise Application Platform / WildFly
* Oracle WebLogic Server
* GlassFish Server
* IBM Websphere Application Server Liberty Profile

.Compatibility Matrix

"Untested" means that integration tests have not been executed on any instance of that specific versions, but the framework is expected to work. "Partial" means that some specific modules may not be available (for further details please refer to the next section).

If a project or customer requires an specific server not included in this list, please contact <{email}>.

== Apache Tomcat considerations

To use the JSF module, the JSF 2.2 specification must be included in the application:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>

  <!-- == Begin JSF 2.2 Specification == -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsf-api</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsf-impl</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <!-- == End JSF 2.2 Specification == -->

</dependencies>
----

== Jetty considerations

As Jetty only has partial Java EE compatibility, not all the framework modules can be used without tweaking the server. The modules known to show problems in Jetty are:

* JSF
* Web services

== JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) considerations

Some modules of the framework have dependency problems when running on JBoss EAP 7. This is a known issue by the JBoss community and has been fixed in the following versions (renamed to "WildFly"). The enterprise versions of JBoss, supported by Red Hat, are derived from the community versions and, hence, share the same problems and fixes.

It is recommended to use WildFly instead of JBoss EAP.

////
Specifically, currently the last enterprise version is JBoss EAP 7 and it is a full Java EE 7 compliant application server based on
Wildfly Community versions. It is the recommended version to use if you want to deploy your application in some JBoss Enterprise
solution.
////

== WildFly 10, 9, 8 and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) 7 considerations

All applications that will be deployed in these environments have to include JavaEE-API dependency as provided in the `pom.xml` of your application:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>

	<!-- == Java EE == -->
	<dependency>
		<groupId>javax</groupId>
		<artifactId>javaee-api</artifactId>
		<scope>provided</scope>
	</dependency>

</dependencies>
----

If you want to use the **web services modules**, the JAX-WS dependency (Java API for XML Web Services) must be explicitly included in the application:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>

  <!-- == Begin Java API for XML Web Services == -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>javax.xml.ws</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxws-api</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <!-- == End Java API for XML Web Services == -->

</dependencies>
----

Anyway, all applications that will be deployed in these environments, must include in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/` the
`jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file which instructs JBoss to not load its copy of Jackson that cause a conflict which the Jackson
library use by the framework.

You can know more about this issue in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-jsr310/issues/33.

The content of this file is:

[source,xml]
.jboss-deployment-structure.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!--
	This jboss-deployment-structure.xml solves the next issue:

	java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access method
			com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.StdSerializer.<init>(Ljava/lang/Class;)V
			from class com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JSR310Module
		at com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JSR310Module.<init>(JSR310Module.java:143)

	@see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-jsr310/issues/33
-->
<jboss-deployment-structure xmlns="urn:jboss:deployment-structure:1.2">
	<deployment>

		<!-- Instructs JBoss/WildFly to not load its copy of Jackson
			and use the application-provided one -->
		<exclusions>
			<module name="org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jackson2-provider"/>
		</exclusions>

	</deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
----

== Oracle WebLogic Server 12c considerations

{framework} web applications show incompatibilities when running on Oracle WebLogic Server (namely, Jackson 2).

A {framework} web application can be deployed on Oracle WebLogic Server using the following `weblogic.xml` configuration file:
[source,xml]
.src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weblogic.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<wls:weblogic-web-app
  xmlns:wls="http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-web-app"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
    http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd
    http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-web-app
    http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-web-app/1.7/weblogic-web-app.xsd">

  <wls:container-descriptor><1>

    <wls:prefer-application-packages><2>
      <wls:package-name>com.fasterxml.jackson.*</wls:package-name><3>
    </wls:prefer-application-packages>

  </wls:container-descriptor>

</wls:weblogic-web-app>
----
<1> The `container-descriptor` element specifies a list of parameters that affect the behavior of the Web application.
<2> The `prefer-application-packages` element specifies a list of packages for classes that must always be loaded from the application. Can not be specified when prefer-web-inf-classes is turned on.
<3> Jackson 2.

Alternatively, the Jackson 2 dependencies (with coordinates `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` and `com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310`) can be excluded from the application.

Also, the modules for consuming REST and Web services will fail when running on Oracle WebLogic Server. To use those modules, it is necessary to set the `enforce-valid-basic-auth-credentials` flag to false, as explained in the https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/web.1211/e24485/thin_client.htm#SCPRG150[Understanding BASIC Authentication with Unsecured Resources] section of the https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/web.1211/e24485/thin_client.htm#SCPRG133[Securing Web Applications] chapter of the https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/index.htm[Oracle WebLogic Server
12c documentation].

////
== GlassFish Server 4

You do not need to do any change, the framework will deploy on this server correctly.

In addition, there is Payara Server, derived from Glashfish and with 24/7 Production Support which replaces
GlassFish Server Open Source Edition so the configuration should be shared.
////

== IBM Websphere Liberty Profile considerations

To use the JSF module, the JSF 2.2 specification must be included in the application:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>

  <!-- == Begin JSF 2.2 Specification == -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsf-api</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsf-impl</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <!-- == End JSF 2.2 Specification == -->

</dependencies>
----

And the server configuration file to be used by the server instance must modify the server features to remove the `jsf-2.2` feature, as the application will be providing the implementation through PrimeFaces:

[source,xml]
.server.xml
----
<server description="server description">

  <featureManager>
    <feature>localConnector-1.0</feature>
    <feature>jsp-2.3</feature>
    <feature>servlet-3.1</feature>
  </featureManager>

</server>
----

== Spring Boot considerations

For the moment, not all the framework modules are supported when using Spring Boot to build applications. Namely, all the web application modules are not supported.

== Spring Multipart Considerations

Spring Multipart is used to accepts file uploads in a Spring Application. By default, Spring Multiparts only accepts uploads of files up to 1 Megabyte. To modify this limit you have to set the next properties in the application-name.properties file or in a file by environment.

[source,properties]
.application-name.properties
----
local.spring.http.multipart.enabled=false <!--1-->
local.spring.http.multipart.location=c:\\temp <!--2-->
local.spring.http.multipart.maxFileSize=20000MB <!--3-->
local.spring.http.multipart.maxRequestSize=20000MB <!--4-->
local.spring.http.multipart.fileSizeThreshold=0 <!--5-->
----
<1> *enabled*: multipart feature enabled
<2> *location*: specifies the directory where files will be stored. The default is "". A common value is to use the system's temporary directory, which can be obtained.
<3> *max-file-size*: specifies the maximum size permitted for uploaded files. The default is 1Mb.
<4> *max-request-size*: specifies the maximum size allowed for multipart/form-data requests. The default is 10Mb
<5> *file-size-threshold*: specifies the size threshold after which files will be written to disk. Default is 0, which means that the file will be written to disk immediately.

== Apache Commons FileUpload - The Streaming API

The traditional API assumes that file items must be stored somewhere before they are actually accessable by the user. This approach is convenient, because it allows easy access to an items contents. On the other hand, it is memory and time consuming. The streaming API allows you to trade a little bit of convenience for optimal performance and a low memory profile. Additionally, the API is more lightweight, thus easier to understand.

=== Example

[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping(value="/uploadStream", method=RequestMethod.POST, headers = "Content-Type=multipart/form-data", consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_OCTET_STREAM_VALUE)
public String importFiles(HttpServletRequest request, @RequestParam("name") String name) throws FileUploadException, IOException {
	boolean isMultipart = ServletFileUpload.isMultipartContent(request);
	if (isMultipart){
		ServletFileUpload upload = new ServletFileUpload();
		FileItemIterator iter = upload.getItemIterator(request);
		while (iter.hasNext()) {
		    FileItemStream item = iter.next();
		    InputStream stream = item.openStream();
		    if (item.isFormField()) {
		        System.out.println("Form field " + item.getFieldName() + " with value " + Streams.asString(stream) + " detected.");
		    } else {
		    	BufferedOutputStream output = null;
		    	try {
			        System.out.println("File field " + item.getFieldName() + " with file name " + item.getName() + " detected.");
			        String path = "c:\\temp\\"+name;
			        output = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(path, false));
			        int data = -1;
			        while ((data = stream.read()) != -1) {
			            output.write(data);
			        }
		    	} catch (IOException ioe) {
		    		ioe.printStackTrace();
		    	} finally {
		    		if (output!=null) {
		    			output.close();
		    		}
		    	}
		    }
		}
		return "File uploaded!!!";
	} else {
		return "Is not multipart!!!";
	}
}
