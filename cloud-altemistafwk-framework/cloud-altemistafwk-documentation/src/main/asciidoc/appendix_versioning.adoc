{framework} will follow a http://semver.org/[semantic versioning] strategy.

Succinctly, given a `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>.RELEASE` version number:

* The _MAJOR_ version will be updated when the API changes. This usually means that there are deep changes in the way something works meaning that existing code won't work if its {framework} version is upgraded blindly. Upgrading Java or Spring Framework versions is another reason to change the _MAJOR_ versions despite no API changes in {framework} itself, as it can break compatibility with existing servers.

* A _MINOR_ versions represent new functionality added or enhancements over the existing one. This will be done in a backwards-compatible manner, so existing {framework} applications can upgrade without changes or, at most, with minimal changes. Usually there won't be necessary to upgrade the existing applications unless they want to use some of the new functionality.

* _PATCH_ versions contains fixes, corrections and enhancements, but no new functionality, and ensure backward-compatibility. Like _MINOR_ versions, existing {framework} applications can be upgraded with no or minimal changes, but in this case they are recommended to upgrade.
