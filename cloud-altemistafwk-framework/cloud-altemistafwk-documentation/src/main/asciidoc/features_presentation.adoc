By default, {framework} web applications and Spring Boot-based applications ship without any specific presentation layer technology beyond static resources and WebJars support.

NOTE: Actually, and without any {framework} presentation layer feature installed, {framework} web applications have the default Servlet of the Servlet container available, though we discourage its usage in favor of relying on Spring MVC always and using the proper view resolver.

For the presentation layer of the application, {framework} provides native integration with different technologies:

* The *JavaServer Pages (JSP)* feature sets up JSP as the view technology (i.e.: as the view resolver of Spring MVC instead of being rendered by the default Servlet of the Servlet container).

ifndef::getting-started[]
* The *Spring Web Flow (SWF)* feature allows implementing the _flows_ of a web application. A flow encapsulates a sequence of steps that guide a user through the execution of some business task.
endif::getting-started[]

* The *Apache Tiles* feature allows to define page fragments which can be assembled into a complete pages.

* The *JavaServer Faces (JSF)* feature allows building component-based user interfaces for web applications using http://www.primefaces.org/[PrimeFaces].

* The *thymelaf* feature is a Java template engine for processing and creating HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS, and text.

ifndef::getting-started[]
*  In addition, alternative presentation layer technology,  https://www.zkoss.org/[ZK], can be used with {framework} as described in the <<presentation-layer-other-technologies,other technologies for the presentation layer>> chapter.

The following table shows the MVC framework and the view technology used dependending on the features installed:

.MVC frameworks and view technologies
|===
|Features installed |MVC framework |View technology

|(none) |Spring MVC |None
|JavaServer Pages (JSP) |Spring MVC |JSP
|Apache Tiles |Spring MVC |Apache Tiles
|JavaServer Faces (JSF) |JSF (component-based) |Facelets
|SWF |Spring Web Flow |None
|SWF and JavaServer Pages (JSP) |Spring Web Flow |JSP
|SWF and Apache Tiles |Spring Web Flow |Apache Tiles
|SWF and JavaServer Faces (JSF) |Spring Web Flow |Facelets
|Thymeleaf |Spring MVC |Thymleaf
|===

WARNING: Despite both Spring Web Flow and JavaServer Faces (JSF) features can be installed together, mixing different MVC strategies is discouraged.
