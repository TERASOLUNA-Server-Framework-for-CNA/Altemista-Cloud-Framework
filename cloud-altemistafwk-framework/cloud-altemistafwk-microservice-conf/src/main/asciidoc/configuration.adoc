{framework} provides `cloud.altemista.fwk.config.microservice.CloudAltemistafwkMicroserviceBuilder` interface that application has to implement as a convenient way to bootstrap and launch a Spring Boot-based {framework} application.

In addition to the usual packages scanned by the framework, a Microservice-based {framework} application will scan the `microservice` subpackage of the application base package for `@Configuration` annotated classes. Place your configuration classes in that package.
