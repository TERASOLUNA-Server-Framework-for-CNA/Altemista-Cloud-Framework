A _web_ module actually extends the {framework} Spring Context to import the configuration of any {framework} web module present in the classpath and sets up the features already described in this chapter.

Namely, the `cloud/altemista/fwk/config/core/cloud-altemistafwk-core-web.xml` configuration file mimics the _autodiscovery_ mechanism of `cloud-altemistafwk-core.xml` but for web modules: runs a component scan for annotated beans under the package `cloud.altemista.fwk.web`, and automatically imports the configuration of any {framework} web module present in the classpath.

Besides the Spring Context, {framework} web modules rely on Servlet 3.0 (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=315[JSR 315: Java Servlet 3.0 Specification]). Namely, they rely on the _web fragment_ mechanism to achieve extensibility and pluggability. From the technical point of view, being web fragments means that most (if not all) of the {framework} web modules contains a `META-INF\web-fragment.xml` with its own Servlet configuration, such as Servlet filters.

However, not all the {framework} application types (i.e.: aggregator types) support web fragments; Spring Boot does not honor `META-INF\web-fragment.xml`. Hence, {framework} web modules duplicate the web fragment configuration in `@Configuration` classes in the package `cloud.altemista.fwk.config.boot`.
