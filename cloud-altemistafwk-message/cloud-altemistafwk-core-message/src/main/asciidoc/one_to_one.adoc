For one to one messaging, a producer sends messages to specified queue. A consumer receives messages from that queue. To ensure message is not lost, message acknowledgments can be sent back to producer to confirm a particular message has been received.


== Main Components

=== Message
This is the object we want to send. In ActiveMQ we can send any Object but in RabbitMQ, the messages are simply streams of bytes, You can send whatever you want in these messages, so you should pick a serializer to convert your objects into byte streams of XML or JSON or whatever you prefer.

=== Producer
The producer sends messages to specified queue.

=== Consumer
A consumer receives messages from that queue.
