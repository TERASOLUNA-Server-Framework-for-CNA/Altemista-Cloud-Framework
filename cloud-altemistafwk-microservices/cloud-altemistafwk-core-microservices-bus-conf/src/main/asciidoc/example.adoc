In order to use this feature correctly, we have to add some properties in BusServices.java
[source,java]
.BusService.java
----
import org.springframework.cloud.context.config.annotation.RefreshScope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@RefreshScope	<!--1-->
@Component		<!--2-->
public class BusService {


	 @Value("${service.prop:notset}")	<!--3-->
    private String aRefreshableProperty;
}
----

<1> A Scope implementation that allows for beans to be refreshed dynamically at runtime 
<2> Indicates that an annotated class is a "component"
<3> a property which is in the config server

Once we run up the config server and the microservices, we could change the property in the config server and refresh it. The change will not reflect in the applications, to do this, refresh the properties using a POST request

[source]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/bus-refresh
----

You can exeucte it by using Postman. The changed property should now reflect on all instances of the application.
