NOTE: The UI was developed by an external team

The users will make use of the UI which uses the REST api exposed by the services through the gateway. That UI application only need to known the public URL of the Gateway.

Our infrastructure services (in blue on the diagram) are:

.Infrastructure services
[options="header"]

^.^|Server        |Port |URL
^.^|Gateway       |8765 |http://localhost:8765
^.^|Config Server |8888 |http://localhost:8888
^.^|Registry      |8761 |http://localhost:8761
