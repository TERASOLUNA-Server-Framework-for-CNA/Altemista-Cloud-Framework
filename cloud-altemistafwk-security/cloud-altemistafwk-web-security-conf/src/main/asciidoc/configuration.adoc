== Forwarding credentials

To enable it, configure the `<security:http>` element as shown:

[source,xml]
.spring/my-application-webapp-security-http.xml
----
<security:http ...>
	...
	<security:form-login /><!--1-->
	<security:custom-filter ref="forwardSecurityCredentialsFilter" before="FORM_LOGIN_FILTER" /><!--2-->
</security:http>
----
<1> The `<security:http>` element *must* have form-login based authentication
<2> The `forwardSecurityCredentialsFilter` is declared in the framework, but must be included as a `<security:custom-filter>` executed before `FORM_LOGIN_FILTER`

With this configuration, when any user logs in the application using the login form, a session scoped bean named `forwardedSecurityCredentials` will be available for the application.

TIP: For an example on how to actually use the forwarding credentials feature, see the <<cloud-altemistafwk-common-rest-forwarding,forwarding user credentials>> section of the <<cloud-altemistafwk-common-rest>> feature.
