== Forwarding credentials

The web part of the security feature includes the possibility of forwarding the Spring Security Credentials to external systems (e.g.: via REST, web services, etc.).

This funcionality is quite limited, but can be useful in development stages to emulate a very simple Single Sign-on.

NOTE: The _forwarding credentials_ feature requires additional configuration, as described in the <<cloud-altemistafwk-web-security-conf-configuration-forwarding,configuration>> section.
