The *SOAP web service publisher (SOAP server)* feature sets up http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] to publish SOAP-based web services.

This feature does not make any assumption on how the SOAP web service interfaces are defined, hence supports both _contract first_ and _contract last_ development style. The definition of the web service interfaces is described in the <<cloud-altemistafwk-common-soap-conf>> section.

This feature is compatible with JAX-WS 2.1 and 2.2 and supports basic authentication using Spring Security.

== Publishing SOAP web services on the server

The SOAP web service publisher (SOAP server) feature automatically sets up Apache CXF to start publishing SOAP-based web services under the mapping `/soap/*` and defines an automatic JAX-WS services exporter that uses the Apache CXF Bus.

To actually publish the web services, declare a Spring bean that implements the proper web service interface to publish.

As an example, given the following web service interface:

[source,java]
.com/mycompany/application/module/soap/HelloWorldService.java
----
package com.mycompany.application.module.soap;

import javax.jws.WebMethod;
import javax.jws.WebService;

@WebService
public interface HelloWorldService {

  @WebMethod
  void helloWorld();
}
----

And a Spring bean that implement that interface:

[source,java]
.com/mycompany/application/module/soap/impl/HelloWorldServiceImpl.java
----
package com.mycompany.application.module.soap.impl;

import com.mycompany.application.module.soap.HelloWorldService;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component("helloWorldService") //<1>
public class HelloWorldServiceImpl implements HelloWorldService { //<2>

  @Override
  public void helloWorld() {
    // (...)
  }
}
----
<1> If both <<cloud-altemistafwk-common-soap-conf-consumer,SOAP web service consumer (SOAP client)>> and <<cloud-altemistafwk-common-soap-conf-publisher,SOAP web service publisher (SOAP server)>> are installed in application the name of the service must be added.
<2> No web services-related annotations are required in the implementation.

To actually publish the web service, use the automatic JAX-WS services exporter provided by the framework:

[source,xml]
.spring/new-application-module-web-soap.java
----
<context:component-scan base-package="com.mycompany.application.module.soap" /> <!--1-->

<bean class="cloud.altemista.fwk.web.soap.SimpleCxfJaxWsServiceExporter"> <!--2-->
   <property name="basePackage" value="com.mycompany.application.module.soap" /> <!--3-->
</bean>
----
<1> Scan for Spring beans declared via annotations
<2> Automatically exports the JAX-WS services using Apache CXF. `SimpleCxfJaxWsServiceExporter`, the exporter provided by the framework, inspects the `@WebService` annotation of the web service interface to provide sensitive default values.
<3> Only the beans contained in this package (or packages) will be published by this exporter. This allows that different business modules use separate configurations.

TIP: This configuration is already included if you have installed the SOAP web service publisher (SOAP server) feature using the Eclipse plug-in or the Maven partial archetype


== Basic authentication

Basic authentication for SOAP server using Spring Security is automatically supported if the _Security (authorization) with Spring Security_ feature has been installed in the application:

[source,xml]
.spring/new-application-webapp-security.xml
----
<security:http pattern="/soap/**"
    authentication-manager-ref="inboundwssAuthenticationManager"
    create-session="stateless"> <!--1--> <!--2-->
  <security:csrf disabled="true" />
  <security:http-basic />
</security:http>
----
<1> The default configuration simply aliases the main Spring Security `AuthenticationManager` of the application for the SOAP server to use it.
<2> Please note that there are no `security:intercept-url` elements. Authentication and authorization is done at application level (e.g.: `@PreAuthorize` annotated methods) rather than at HTTP level.
