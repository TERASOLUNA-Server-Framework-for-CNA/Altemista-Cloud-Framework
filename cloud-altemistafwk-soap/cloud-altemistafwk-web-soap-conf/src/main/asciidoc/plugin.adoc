The _SOAP web service publisher (SOAP server)_ feature requires the `web` nature to be installed.

At the moment there is only one implementation available: Apache CXF.

IMPORTANT: A project defining the SOAP web service interface is required. Please refer to the <<cloud-altemistafwk-common-soap-conf>> section.
