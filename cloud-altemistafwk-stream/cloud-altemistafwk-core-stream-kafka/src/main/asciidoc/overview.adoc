{framework} Spring cloud stream Features lets your project incorporate https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams[Kafka^] easily.  Kafka Streams is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters. It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka's server-side cluster technology.

Kafka is often used in real-time streaming data architectures to provide real-time analytics. Since Kafka is a fast, scalable, durable, and fault-tolerant publish-subscribe messaging system, Kafka is used in use cases where JMS, RabbitMQ, and AMQP may not even be considered due to volume and responsiveness. Kafka has higher throughput, reliability, and replication characteristics, which makes it applicable for things like tracking service calls (tracks every call) or tracking IoT sensor data where a traditional MOM might not be considered.
