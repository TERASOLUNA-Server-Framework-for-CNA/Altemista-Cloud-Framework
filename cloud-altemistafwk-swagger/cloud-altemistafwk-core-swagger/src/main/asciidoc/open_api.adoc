The OpenAPI Specification is an API description format or API definition language. Basically, an OpenAPI Specification file allow you to describe an API including (among other things):

* General information about the API
* Available paths (/resources)
* Available operations on each path (get /resources)
* Input/Output for each operation

Using an API definition language such as OpenAPI specification helps to describe easily and quickly an API.
