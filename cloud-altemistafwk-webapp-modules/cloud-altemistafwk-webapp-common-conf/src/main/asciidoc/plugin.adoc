The _Presentation layer: Common functionality_ feature can be installed in either a web application aggregator project, or a Spring Boot-based aggregator project.

In the case of web applications, this feature is embedded in the _JavaServer Pages (JSP)_, _Apache Tiles_, and _JavaServer Faces (JSF)_ features, so installing any of those features will transitively include the _common functionality_ feature. However, it is convenient to install this feature in a stand-alone manner when setting up alternative presentation layer technologies, as described in the <<presentation-layer-other-technologies,other technologies for the presentation layer>> chapter.
