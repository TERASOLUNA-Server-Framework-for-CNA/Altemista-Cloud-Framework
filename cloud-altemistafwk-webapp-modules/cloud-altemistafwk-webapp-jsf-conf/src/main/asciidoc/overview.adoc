JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a Java specification for building component-based user interfaces for web applications, with Facelets as its default templating system.

This feature allows building component-based user interfaces for web applications using http://www.primefaces.org/[PrimeFaces].

CAUTION: JSF is *not* a view technology but a MVC framework. Spring MVC and JSF are competitors with a different ideology (JSF is component based and Spring MVC is a request based) and should not be mixed.

== Spring beans as Managed Beans

To be able to use Spring beans as managed beans (and hence benefit from Spring dependency injection), do not mix JSF annotations with Spring annotations.

To work with JSF-managed beans, injection of dependencies can be achieved as follows:
[source]
----
@ManagedBean
@RequestScoped
public class JsfManagedBean {

	@ManagedProperty("#{springBeanName}")
	private SpringBeanClass springBean;

	public void setSpringBean(SpringBeanClass pSpringBean) { //<1>
		this.springBean = pSpringBean;
	}
}
----
<1> Setter required.

On the other hand, to let Spring manage your beans, use the next set of annotations:
[source]
----
@Component
@Scope("request")
public class SpringManagedBean {

	@Autowired
	private SpringBeanClass springBean; //<1>
}
----
<1> No setter required.

== Internationalization (I18n)

As stated in the <<cloud-altemistafwk-webapp-common-conf-i18n>> section of the _presentation layer: common functionality_ feature, and as any other {framework} application, a JSF-based {framework} application starts with the default locale.

When using the JSF feature, an `ActionListener` that allows for changing the current locale on a request is automatically set up out-of-the-box to mimic the behaviour of Spring MVC `LocaleChangeInterceptor`. Therefore, any request with the parameter `locale` will propagate the selected locale to both the user session, and Spring `LocaleContextHolder`, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<h:commandLink action="changeLocale" value="Switch to Japanese">
	<f:param name="locale" value="jp" />
</h:commandLink>
----

== Securing JavaServer Facelets

The module includes the *Spring Security Facelets Tag Library* which allows the use the authorize tag in your views.

It is important to notice that this feature works in combination with Spring Security so, *the security module has to be included in the webapp application*.

Following, there is an example which shows how to include nested content conditionally:

[source,xml]
----
<ui:composition xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
	xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"
	xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
	xmlns:sec="http://www.springframework.org/security/tags">

	<sec:authorize ifAllGranted="ROLE_FOO, ROLE_BAR">
		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
	</sec:authorize>

	<sec:authorize ifNotGranted="ROLE_FOO, ROLE_BAR">
		Consectetur adipiscing elit
	</sec:authorize>

	<sec:authorize ifAnyGranted="ROLE_FOO, ROLE_BAR">
		Pellentesque ex sem
	</sec:authorize>

</ui:composition>
----

== Special considerations

Once the web application has been configured as stated in the <<cloud-altemistafwk-webapp-jsf-conf-configuration,configuration>> section, there are only a few special considerations when coding the JSF views:

=== Internationalized messages using expression language (EL)

ACF extends the `SpringBeanFacesELResolver` to ease printing internationalized messages (without parameters) simply accessing the Spring `MessageSource` bean using the expression language:

[source,xml]
./welcome-page.xhtml
----
<h1>#{msg.welcomeTitle}</h1><!--1-->
<p>#{messageSource.welcome.page.text}</p><!--2-->
----
<1> The `MessageSource` bean is published by default under the names `messageSource` and the shorter `msg`.
<2> Property keys with dots are also supported.

=== CodeList

By default, code list bean will be accessible by a managed bean "codeList" that load all list with Id patter by default ".+". It's possible redefine this pattern in a property value.

[source,text]
.webapp.properties
----
*.codeListIdPattern=CL_.+
----

[source,xml]
./welcome.xhtml
----
<p:dataTable var="item" value="#{codeList.get('CL_I18N_PRICE')}"> <!--1-->
	<p:column headerText="Key">
		<h:outputText value="#{item.key}" /> <!--2-->
	</p:column>

	<p:column headerText="Value">
		<h:outputText value="#{item.value}" /> <!--3-->
	</p:column>
</p:dataTable>
----
<1> The codelist managed bean is published by default under the name `codeList`. Call `get` method in order to get a specific codelist.
<2> Show key for each element in the code list.
<3> Show value for each element in the code list.

=== Exception in error pages

When rendering error pages, a managed bean `errorHandler` is provided to get the exception details. This bean allows easy access to the default request attributes (those starting with `"javax.servlet.error"`):

[source,xml]
./custom-error-page.xhtml
----
<ul>
	<li>Exception: #{errorHandler.exception}</li>
	<li>Exception type: #{errorHandler.exceptionType}</li>
	<li>Message: #{errorHandler.message}</li>
	<li>Request URI: #{errorHandler.requestUri}</li>
	<li>Servlet name: #{errorHandler.servletName}</li>
	<li>Status code: #{errorHandler.statusCode}</li>
</ul>
----
